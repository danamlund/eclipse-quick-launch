Eclipse quick launch

Run launch configurations like Ctrl-Shift-T

Launch with Ctrl-Shift-Y
or (debug) with Ctrl-Shift-D

In oxygen Ctrl-Shift-Y is already bound to lower case something,
you might have to unbind that.

There is also a new menu entry under "Run".

Tested when built on

and installed (put into dropins/ folder)
  Eclipse oxygen a1
